<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm Biose Peter Chukwuasia, an IT specialist with a passion for technology and education. I work as an IT Specialist at Skypeak Loan Company, where I develop and maintain websites using WordPress, edit and produce videos with Filmora, Adobe Premiere Pro, and After Effects, and assist with event setups involving projectors. I also provide virtual assistance services, offering administrative support, scheduling, and customer service.</p>

<p>In addition to my work in IT, I'm a dedicated teacher, constantly exploring ways to integrate technology into education. I believe in the power of AI and digital tools to enhance learning and am actively pursuing courses in virtual assistance and IT-related certifications. My interests also extend to Nigerian history, particularly the story of Okpoho, and I enjoy exploring new technologies that can make a difference in education.</p>

<p>When I'm not working or teaching, I enjoy learning about new software and platforms, ranging from basic computer concepts to advanced programming environments like Alice 3. Iâ€™m always eager to expand my knowledge and stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech world.</p>
